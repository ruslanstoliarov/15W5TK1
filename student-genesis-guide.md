# The Genesis Guide: Building Your Project Dynamics

**Welcome, Captain.**
You are not just building a class project. You are building a **System** to build the project.
This guide provides the roadmap for your collaboration with your AI Teammate (SAP).

---

## 0. THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE (The Final Deliverable)

Your semester grade is based on a **Completion Report** that demonstrates your **Learning Process** and the **AI Skills** you have gained.
This report must document two distinct components of AI application. You must build your project to satisfy both:

### Component A: AI in Meta-Project Management (The "Workshop")
*   **Focus:** How did you use AI to *manage* the work?
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **Structure:** How you used AI to design your SSoT (`0_Meta`).
    *   **Team:** How you defined your Agent Roles (HP vs. SAP).
    *   **Protocols:** How you established communication (SaaM) and memory management (Context Engineering).
    *   **Tools:** How you used scripts (Deserializer) to automate administration.

### Component B: AI in Actual Project Execution (The "Car")
*   **Focus:** How did you use AI to *create* the specific domain deliverable?
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   **Research:** Using AI to find the "State of the Art."
    *   **Planning:** Using AI to draft blueprints and technical specs.
    *   **Implementation:** Using AI to generate code, assets, or text.
    *   **Refinement:** The "20% Human Value-Add" where you polished the AI's output.

## PART 1: THE META-PROJECT (Building the "Workshop")
*Focus: Component A - Governance, Team, and Structure.*

Do not rush to build the folders. First, define *how* you want to work. Use these steps to guide your discussion with the SAP.

### Step A: Architectural Research (The Structure)
**The Problem:** Every project needs a "Brain" (Governance). We have defined `0_Meta` for this. But what else do you need?
*   **Goal:** Define a folder structure that fits *your* specific project.
*   **Suggested Meta-Prompt:**
    > "We need to design the optimal folder structure for my [Project Topic]. We already have `0_Meta` for governance. Based on the nature of my project (e.g., heavy on 3D assets, or heavy on code), what other top-level directories should we create? Guide me through this architectural decision."

### Step B: Team Building (The Agents)
**The Problem:** You (HP) and the SAP are the core team. But complex projects might need specialists.
*   **Goal:** Define the "Corporation of Agents."
*   **Suggested Meta-Prompt:**
    > "Act as a CTO. Analyze my Project Profile. Should we expand our team beyond just you and me? Suggest 2-3 specialized 'AI Autons' (e.g., a Blender Scripting Specialist or a Research Analyst) that would help us. Define their roles."

### Step C: Protocol Definition (The Rules)
**The Problem:** How do we communicate? How do we save data?
*   **Goal:** Establish the "Rules of Engagement."
*   **Suggested Meta-Prompt:**
    > "We need a 'Constitution' for our collaboration. Propose a set of protocols for: 1. How we track tasks. 2. How we name files. 3. How you will report progress to me. Let's list these in `0_Meta/README.md`."

## PART 2: THE CLASS PROJECT (Building the "Car")
*Focus: Component B - The actual deliverable (e.g., The 3D Model, The App, The Thesis).*

### Step D: Research Methodology (The "Think 1")
**The Problem:** Don't just start building. You need to know the "State of the Art."
*   **Goal:** Define *how* to research.
*   **Suggested Meta-Prompt:**
    > "Before we plan the implementation, we need to perform deep research. Initiate a guided discussion on *how* we should research [My Topic]. What sources should we look for? What are the key technical challenges we need to identify first?"

### Step E: Execution of Research
**The Problem:** Gathering the intelligence.
*   **Goal:** Create the `Research_Analysis.md`.
*   **Suggested Meta-Prompt:**
    > "Let's execute the research plan we just discussed. Act as a Senior Researcher. Search for the State of the Art in [My Topic]. Focus on [Specific Aspect, e.g., Topology for VR]. Summarize the findings into a 'Knowledge Base' document."

### Step F: Implementation Planning
**The Problem:** Turning research into action.
*   **Goal:** Create the Roadmap.
*   **Suggested Meta-Prompt:**
    > "Based on our Research and my Student Profile, let's create a 'Project Implementation Plan'. Break the project down into 3 phases (Prototype, Alpha, Final). For each phase, list the specific tasks the 'Human' will do and the tasks the 'AI' will do."

## 3. The "Accumulation" Philosophy

**Remember:**
Simple steps lead to complex systems.
1.  Discuss the problem.
2.  Agree on a solution.
3.  **Serialize** the result (Save the file).
4.  Move to the next step.

*Your project complexity will grow naturally from these simple interactions.*
