# 10 Project Ideas for W5TK1
*Selected based on Class Requirements: AI Agents, Generative AI (ComfyUI), and VR/XR.*

## 🏛️ Type A: "The Builder" (Asset & VR Heavy)
*Best for: Students who want to learn Blender, Unity/Unreal, and Visual Generative AI.*

**1. The Infinite Art Gallery (VR)**
*   **Concept:** A VR Museum where the paintings and sculptures are generated in real-time by an AI Agent based on the visitor's mood or voice input.
*   **Tech Stack:** Unity (VR), ComfyUI (Image Gen), Local LLM (Curator Agent).

**2. Historical Re-enactment Simulator**
*   **Concept:** Recreate a specific historical room (e.g., Einstein's Office). Use ComfyUI to generate textures and reference images, and an AI Agent to "roleplay" the historical figure via text-to-speech.
*   **Tech Stack:** Blender, Stable Diffusion, RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

**3. Dreamscapes: The AI Interior Designer**
*   **Concept:** An application where a user describes a room ("Cyberpunk bedroom"), and the system generates the 3D layout and textures automatically.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python Scripting in Blender, ControlNet.

## 🧠 Type B: "The Architect" (Code & Logic Heavy)
*Best for: Students who prefer Python, System Architecture, and LLMs.*

**4. The "Devil's Advocate" Debater**
*   **Concept:** A system with two AI Agents (Profile A and Profile B) that debate a topic provided by the user. The user acts as the Judge.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, OpenAI API/Ollama, Prompt Engineering (System Prompts).

**5. The Personal Learning Avatar**
*   **Concept:** An embodied AI avatar (V-Tuber style) that tracks your study habits and quizzes you on your notes.
*   **Tech Stack:** Unity, Whisper (Voice-to-Text), LLM for Logic.

**6. Automated News Analyst**
*   **Concept:** An agent swarm that scrapes 5 different news sites, compares the bias in their reporting, and generates a "Neutral Summary" every morning.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python Scrapers, LangChain, Vector Database.

**7. The "Dungeon Master" AI**
*   **Concept:** A text-based RPG where the AI tracks inventory, health, and generates the story dynamic based on dice rolls.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, Context Management (MemGPT concept), JSON Data Storage.

## 🔧 Type C: "The Toolsmith" (Workflow Automation)
*Best for: Students who want to build tools for other developers.*

**8. The "Prompt-to-Code" Serializer**
*   **Concept:** (Meta-Project) A sophisticated version of the current project system. A tool that takes a rough idea and generates a full VS Code folder structure with boilerplate code.
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, Regex, File I/O.

**9. ComfyUI Custom Node Developer**
*   **Concept:** Creating a custom node for ComfyUI that performs a specific complex task (e.g., pulling weather data to influence image generation lighting).
*   **Tech Stack:** Python, ComfyUI API.

**10. Local-First Personal Assistant (Jarvis Lite)**
*   **Concept:** A voice-activated assistant that runs entirely offline on your laptop to control music, open apps, and answer questions.
*   **Tech Stack:** Llama 3 (Local), Python `os` libraries, Speech Recognition.
